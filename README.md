# WeatherApp

The application is designed to display the weather forecast for 10 days, as well as houses for the selected day, by geolocation, as well as search by city name
Before building the application, make sure that your API KEY value is inserted in the apikey.proporties file.
You can get it in your account on the website https://www.weatherapi.com/
If the application does not work, the free period of the API key from JSON weather keys has most likely ended.
Go to https://www.weatherapi.com/ to get an API Key or contact me to enable this key. Thanks in advance
